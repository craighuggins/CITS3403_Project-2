# CITS3403: Agile Web Development Project 2020

This project is developed for the unit Agile Web Development at The University of Western Australia. For this project we were required to build a multi-user quiz/questionaire/survey application. The application allows administrators to set question sets, users to submit answers to the questions, and manual or automatic assessment of those answers. The context of the questions have flexibility and are upto administrators to decide.

## Purpose

This application can be used for Buzzfeed style quizzes in education sector. Administrators (such as teachers and unit coordinators) can add questions and create question sets. Users (students) of the application can start a question set and complete questions. The answers by the users can be viewed and the results of the assessments are made available.

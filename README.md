# CITS3403: Agile Web Development Project 2020

This project is developed for the unit Agile Web Development at The University of Western Australia. For this project we were required to build a multi-user quiz/questionaire/survey application. The application allows administrators to set question sets, users to submit answers to the questions, and manual or automatic assessment of those answers. The context of the questions have flexibility and are upto administrators to decide.

## Purpose

This application can be used for Buzzfeed style quizzes in education sector. Administrators (such as teachers and unit coordinators) can add questions and create question sets. Users (students) of the application can start a question set and complete questions. The answers by the users can be viewed and the results of the assessments are made available.

## Architecture

The client-side of the web application is designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The server-side is made using Flask and the dataase is developed on SQLite. A single web server and a single database is used. In the current architecture, when a user opens the website, the web server responds to the requests with approprite HTML and in general............


## Launching the application

- Ensure that all the libraries required for this web application are upto date. Use ```pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt``` to install all the libraries.
- To run the web server application, use ```flask run```
